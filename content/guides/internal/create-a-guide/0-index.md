# How to create a guide

This guide will take you through the steps to get set up to start creating
guides for `developer.box.com`.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have:

1. `Node.js` installed, ideally Node 13 or higher
1. The Yarn package manager installed, by running `npm i -g yarn` 
1. `Git` installed
1. A code editor installed. We recommend using Visual Studio Code.

## Overview

In this guide we will take you through the following steps:

1. Clone all the code repositories so you have all the files needed to see a
   preview of your guide.
1. Configure all the environment variables so that the preview only builds
   guides.
1. Start both the content and the preview server.
1. Add the guide content for the guide you want to write.
1. Commit the changes to GitHub
1. Preview changes on our staging site
1. And finally, merge all the changes once they are approved.
